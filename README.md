<h3 align="center"> A Zoo Tycoon 1 Scripting API for Modders</h3>

Vanilla Zoo Tycoon 1 has over a 20 year history of modding but users have only been able to modify the game through editing of INI configuration files. This project enhances modding capabilities by giving modders Lua scripting support so that they can create more complex and interesting mods.

### Compatibility

To use this API, you must:

- Own the Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection, or the base game with both expansions installed.
- Have a Windows 7 or newer operating system.
- Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).

### Build from Source

The .sln file has been included for the option to build from source. The project is build with Visual Studio 2022.

### Installation

Drop the res-EMU.dll binary directly into your `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon` game directory.

### Documentation

Reference documentation for the the debug console and API can be found at the Zooberry Docs reference section: [EMU API Reference](https://docs.zooberry.org/zt1/reference/emu/).
