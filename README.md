 A Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection API

Currently only one function has been interfaced, but project is still early:

<code>addToBudget({class pointer}, float transaction)</code>

Current plans are to interface with this function as a VF Table as right now it's isolated from the main class it originates from.

The API is functional on computers with Windows XP and above give that Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable is installed.

Instructions to build and use will not be available until the project has reached a level of acceptable maturity. Estimated 2-3 months before first usable release that can be extended by others.
